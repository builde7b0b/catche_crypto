# Bug Bombs and Coins Timing
sometimes there's a bug where the bombs and coins drop in a straight line together, it's almost impossible to not fail. Let's ensure we always have a proportionate number of bombs relative to our coins that makes sense and doesn't exhibit weird behavior. 

# SOUND EFFECTS [DONE]
[X]Let's add some sound effects.
[X]WHen the player catches a bomb, let's have an explosion sound. 
[X]When the player catches a coin, let's have a coin sound that's attractive and not too annoying but satisfying.
Then let's add a soundtrack so user's can enjoy playing the game.

# Mobile behavior and Bugs [x]
Let's ensure that we provide the user with a full view of the canvas and controls/buttons no matter what device they are on.
Our current behavior on mobile is that it's a little zoomeed out and also when a user double taps the screen to try and click our button, it zooms us in. How can we disable or  modify this behavior for our needs?


# Description: 
a simple "Catch the Crypto Coins" game using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. In this game, the player needs to move a character left and right to catch falling cryptocurrency coins while avoiding bombs.
