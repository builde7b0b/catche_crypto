The power-up is represented by a green rectangle that appears above the player character when active.
Power-ups spawn as coins every 10 seconds using the spawnPowerUp() function.
When the player collides with a power-up coin, the activatePowerUp() function is called, which sets powerUpActive to true, increases the player's speed, and starts a timer for the power-up duration.
After the power-up duration (5 seconds in this example), the deactivatePowerUp() function is called, which restores the player's speed and clears the power-up timer.
The checkCollision() function is modified to handle power-up collisions separately from regular coin collisions.


Wave 2: 
Power-ups:

The power-up is now a unique item with a green color.
When the player collects a power-up, a sound effect is played.


Obstacles:

Obstacles are spawned every 3 seconds and move downwards.
If the player collides with an obstacle, the game ends.


Checkpoints:

Checkpoints are spawned every 20 seconds.
When the player collides with a checkpoint, a sound effect is played, and the checkpoint disappears.


Boss battles:

When the player's score reaches 50, a boss battle is triggered.
The boss has a health bar, and the player needs to collide with the boss multiple times to defeat it.
Defeating the boss grants bonus points.


Sound effects and background music:

Background music is played during the game and loops continuously.
Sound effects are played for power-ups, checkpoints, and boss battles.


Main menu screen:

The main menu screen is not included in this code snippet, but you can create a separate HTML page with options to start a new game, view high scores, and adjust settings.
